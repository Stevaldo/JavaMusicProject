# Music Project

**Note:** Only the source code is included in this repository due to the large file size of the audio files. The complete project, including all files, is available locally.

## Setup Instructions

### Audio Files
1. Download the desired song in WAV format.
2. Place the WAV file in the `audio` folder inside the `src` directory.
3. Make sure to import the SQL database before running the app.
4. Update your MySQL database server name in the configuration to play the song.

### Important Note
WAV files are large, so itâ€™s recommended to test with one song initially. The entire project, when using all WAV files, totals approximately 4GB.
